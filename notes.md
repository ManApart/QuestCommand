# Quest Command

An open world rpg with intense levels of interact, experienced through the command prompt

## Planning and Ideas

While the readme should cover how to build and run the game, as well with information on how the game works, these notes are the design docs of the game and should frequently change and be deleted (and changed to readme documentation) once the feature is implemented.

### Architecture

- Better package organization for actions
- Packages are still a mess
- Make activators / items able to extend others (parse all, loop through each copying base and updating properties on each sub-item etc)
- Set activator copy's location to spawned location
- Reset vs Reload. Reset resets game state, reload reloads json?
- Flow of param overrides (left overrides right)
  - Item Params > inheritable params > Behavior Params/Properties > Conditions/events
- Break scope manager and item manager listeners into own classes
- make evaluate and execute return true/ a number so caller can be aware if behavior etc found
- Managers etc should return copies of items so that the parsed ones are immutable

#### Persistence
- Tree continues burning even after leaving it and coming back (Persistence within session)
 - When the location is saved it should store the 'last tic timer' and then compare to the current timer to know number of tics passed
- Persistence should happen across sessions.

### Crafting

- Cooking / recipes
  - Burn if not enough skill
  - Gain xp for cooking

### Combat

#### Thoughts and Description
In battle, a creature can act when it attains 100 action points. Action points are recovered based on the creature's agility, alternating between the two creatures. When 100 ap are achieved, the creature gets a turn and the ap are reset to 0. During a turn, a player can take any normal command / action, but will generally choose a battle action. The player can equip either hand, or use a hand. Each of the battle commands default's to the right hand, but can be preferenced with right or left to indicate a hand. If block is chosen without a hand preference, it will default to the hand that has a shield, is armed, or the right hand.
 
Block can be high, low or medium. If the player blocks high and the opponent strikes high, the shield will take all damagage. If the opponent strikes medium (one height away from block area), the shield takes medium damage (and low, the sheild would block no damage).
 
Weapons have different reach and the player may need to step closer, or step back to avoid a blow.

Agility affects how quickly someone can attack, strength how much the attack does, perception how likely to hit, etc

Each Turn
- Increase combatants AP by their agility level until one person hits 100
- Each action takes AP. Bare fists take 1 ap, the bigger the weapon (size keyword) the more ap it takes
- Each action drains stamina. The heavier the weapon the more stamina drained
- Without enough stamina the combatant canâ€™t do anything
- A Combatant can rest to recover stamina points


Attacking with heavier weapons does what?
- Costs more action points (instead of always resetting to 0 be based on weapon)?
- Drains stamina?
- Is only an issue if the weapon is heavy compared to your strength level?

Attacking different body parts do anything? What's the point of the attack direction?

#### Battle Skill ideas
- Barehanded
- Right and Left handed
- Short sword, sword, axe, lance

#### Battle Command Ideas
Battle Commands (each can take a direction), (default to item in right hand, option to add left)
- Slash - grazing damage but generally fast (hand slaps)
- Chop - most damage, slowest
- Stab -
- Crush
- Dodge
- Block
- Step (forward, back) (ranges: knife, sword, lance, bow)

#### Other
- Boss that you fight by climbing, hitting, getting thrown off, taking fall damage, repeating
- Attack direction should use previous target


### General UI

- find a way to allow auto complete with tab
- preferences for what messages show
- Possible CLI Tools
    - [Clink](http://mridgers.github.io/clink/)
    - [Picocli](https://github.com/remkop/picocli)
    - [JLine](https://jline.github.io/)  

### Quests

Active Quests
- only some events being active eliminates ability to do OR statement
- Completed - event has been completed
- Repeatable - can be hit even if completed before
- AvailableAfter - After this stage this event can be hit if the conditions are met, even if that means skipping other stages. If blank available only when this is the next highest stage after current stage
- AvailableUntil - once this stage has been hit, this event can no longer be active. If blank available until is just the next highest quest stage after this
- each event has a stage. When the event runs the quest is automatically updated to be that stage

Other
- First time hints / build out tutorial

### Stats

- Stats have skills that are improved by XP, attributes that improve through level up points, and derived stats like health
- Or stats improve by use, attributes are like stat categories and improve when their stats improve, properties are derived from attributes (health, endurance, etc)

### Travel

- Redo move command to move to location by finding path is possible
- Make starting a journey event based / handle replacing an existing event
- Maybe journey mode for travel and climb, progress events that can succeed, fail, or spawn other events
- Update how routing works
 - Use some path finding to find nearest area by evaluating nodes out from center node
 - let map be used for route planning

#### Climbing
- You can jump down if a location is below you, you'll take damage based on your agility + the distance to fall
- Look during climb says the options you can go
- Convert climbing paths to generic paths with directions dictating next path instead of up/down only?
- Burning the apple tree branches should make the user fall

### Validation tools

- Separate from test suite
- Check for duplicate names (across items, recipes, and activators)
- Check all targets reference valid events etc (triggers and trigger events)
- Check all activator targets reference actual items / locations etc
- Check all behavior receipies have params that match their assigned behaviors


### Misc / Unsorted
- Readable behavior / item
- Be consistent. End with periods or without them.
- Remove hatchet and apple from starting inventory and place them in world etc
- Directly cook recipe
- Inventory carrying space

#### Command ideas
- Search - skill based, finds scope that's hidden
- Look (examine) object for its description
- Sheath / unsheath command?
- Hold Command?
